            <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them to desired actions.(Interaction Design Foundation - IxDF. (2016, August 31). What is Visual Hierarchy?. Interaction Design Foundation - IxDF. https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy)</p>

            <p>The rule of thirds is a "rule of thumb" for composing visual images such as designs, films, paintings, and photographs.[3] The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections.[4] Proponents[who?] of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension, energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject.(Bryan F. Peterson (2003). Learning to see creatively. Amphoto Press. ISBN 0-8174-4181-6.)</p>

            <p>White space, or "negative space", refers to the space left near elements or between elements during design or page layout, often ignored. Although many people think that white space is a waste of screen space, white space is an indispensable element in web design. "White space should be regarded as an element that can be used, rather than just is viewed negatively as a background," Jan Tschichold wrote in 1930.</p>
