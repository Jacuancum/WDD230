            <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them to desired actions.(Interaction Design Foundation - IxDF. (2016, August 31). What is Visual Hierarchy?. Interaction Design Foundation - IxDF. https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy)</p><img id="small_pic" src="images/visual hierarchy four elements.png" alt="visual hierarchy four elements"><p>This website of Snow Peak Outdoor Lifestyle homepage can be identify visual-hierarchy elements.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

            <p>The rule of thirds is a "rule of thumb" for composing visual images such as designs, films, paintings, and photographs.[3] The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections.[4] Proponents[who?] of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension, energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject.(Bryan F. Peterson (2003). Learning to see creatively. Amphoto Press. ISBN 0-8174-4181-6.)</p><img id="small_pic" src="images/rule of thirds landscape.jpeg" alt="rule of thirds landscape"><p>The picture of the Fuji mountain on the top of Cathay Pacific homepage is a comfortable picture. The composition of the picture is clear. A back view of a family on the bottom. The Fuji on the top. Both right hand side and left hand side are plain. Customers can get a very simple message from it which is a family is going on a trip to Japan.</p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p>Apple</p>

            <img src="images/apple homepage.jpg" alt="apple homepage">
            <p>White space, or "negative space", refers to the space left near elements or between elements during design or page layout, often ignored. Although many people think that white space is a waste of screen space, white space is an indispensable element in web design. "White space should be regarded as an element that can be used, rather than just is viewed negatively as a background," Jan Tschichold wrote in 1930.</p><p>The homepage of apple is very simple. Messy pages make users eager to read and are unattractive. White space prevents users from seeing all text messages at the same time, which makes reading easier.</p>
